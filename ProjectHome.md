Navigator7 is an add-on for Vaadin

http://vaadin.com/directory#addon/120

API for more web-oriented applications.
  * Notion of application level window that includes a page
  * Easy navigation between pages
  * Templating around pages (as header/footer/...)
  * Support for fixed design.
  * Better support for multi-tab browsing.
  * Rich URI analysis, with entry points for your persistency code (as JPA).
  * "confirm/save before leave" support.

It is used in production for BlackBeltFactory.com.

This is version 7 because ... Vaadin 7 should improve to the point this addon is useless ;-) May be used to support discussion around Vaadin 7 API?
